The middleware is a function that resist btw the request and the response
There could be lots of middleare btw them for example :

app.use(mid1);
app.use(mid2);
app.use(mid3);
app.use(mid4);
...

app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
    res.send('Hello World')
});

The order of middles is important, especially if one middleware is based on another one;
